![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/644672989014523940.svg)](https://discord.gg/MqNKpdrGjw)

This is a template for a Discord bot v14 handler using TypeScript. It is a starting point for building a bot that supports prefix commands and slash commands. The codebase is written in TypeScript, offering a strongly-typed, object-oriented approach to building the bot. This repository is designed to help you quickly get up and running with your bot development, and serves as a foundation for more complex features and integrations. Whether you're new to Discord bot development or looking to switch to TypeScript, this repository is a great starting point.
